## What is Grand Farm Partner Management?

Grand Farm aims to capitalize on the region's potential in the agriculture and technology industries. As Grand Farm continues to grow, other companies are recruited to help with their mission. Keeping track of deliverables, projects, and tasks are becoming more and more difficult. Weâ€™re aiming to build a collaborative task-management application to help keep things simple. The primary goal of this app will be to help keep track of due dates, project deadlines, upcoming events, and everything else needed to make ideas become a reality.

## Who is it for?

Grand Farm Partner Management is strictly for partners of Grand Farm. When a company is created, a request is sent to Grand Farm. Once approved, they are now permitted to create projects.
